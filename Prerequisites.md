# X-Code
  1. Open Terminal
  2. Make sure the XCode Developer tools are installed:
  ```
  xcode-select --install
  ```
  This command opens an installation dialog box if needed, or if it's already installed, you see xcode-select: error: 
  `command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates` in your Terminal window. Complete the XCode update if needed.
