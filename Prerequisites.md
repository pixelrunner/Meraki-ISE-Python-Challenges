# X-Code
  1. Open Terminal
  2. Make sure the XCode Developer tools are installed:
  ```
  xcode-select --install
  ```
  This command opens an installation dialog box if needed, or if it's already installed, you see `xcode-select: error: 
  command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates` in your Terminal window. Complete the XCode update if needed.

# Homebrew
Run the installation command from within the terminal:

``` 
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Example output you see in Terminal:

```
 # Sample Final Output
 ==> Installation successful!

 ==> Homebrew has enabled anonymous aggregate user behaviour analytics.
 Read the analytics documentation (and how to opt-out) here:
   https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics.html

 ==> Next steps:
 - Run `brew help` to get started
 - Further documentation:
     https://docs.brew.sh
```

Verify successful installation by checking the version:
```
 brew -v
```

You see this output, with your version number, as shown:

```
 # Sample Output
 Homebrew 2.2.2
 Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 7ac88; last commit 2020-01-02)
 Homebrew/homebrew-cask (git revision 8f0543; last commit 2020-01-02)
```

Homebrew provides access to many standard applications and packages, but isn't optimized for large binary-based applications. As an extension to brew, cask is available. To validate, you can list installed Casks:
```
 brew cask list
```

# Python(3.x)

Open a Terminal window and use brew to install Python 3.x.

```
brew install python
```

You should see output like so:

```
 # Sample Final Output
 Python has been installed as
   /usr/local/bin/python3

 Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
 `python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
   /usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin

 If you need Homebrew's Python 2.7 run
   brew install python@2

 Pip, setuptools, and wheel have been installed. To update them run
   pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

 You can install Python packages with
   pip3 install <package>
 They will install into the site-package directory
   /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages

 See: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python
 ==> Summary
 (brew)  /usr/local/Cellar/python/3.6.5: 4,705 files, 99.5MB
 ```
# Node
Node.js is a Javascript runtime enviropnment used for prerendering Javascript on the server rather than in the browser.

## Installation
Open a terminal and use brew to install Node.

```
 brew install node
 ```
 
 ```
 This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
 because macOS provides libicucore.dylib (but nothing else).

 If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

 For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
     LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib
     CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include
     
 ==> Summary
 (brew)  /usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/61.1: 249 files, 67.2MB
 ==> Installing node
 ==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/node-10.9.0.high_sierra.bottle.tar.gz
 ######################################################################## 100.0%
 ==> Pouring node-10.9.0.high_sierra.bottle.tar.gz
 ==> Caveats
 Bash completion has been installed to:
   /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
 ==> Summary
 (brew)  /usr/local/Cellar/node/10.9.0: 5,125 files, 49.7MB
 ```
 
Note: If you already have Node installed, you will need to run the following command instead: 
```
brew upgrade node
```

## Verification
1. Open a Terminal window.
2. Check the installed Node version.
```
 node -v
```

This shows the output you see in return:
```
 # Expected Output
 v10.9.0
``` 

# IDE
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

You will need to install an IDE of your choice that supports python. If you don't have a preference, try one of the following.

## PyCharm
The most used IDE for python is PyCharm.
[jetbrains.com/pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

## Visual Studio Code
This IDE is made by Microsoft. It's basic, but does the job.
